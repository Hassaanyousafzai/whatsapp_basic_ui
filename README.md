# whatsapp_basic_ui

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a basic implementation of a WhatsApp user interface using Flutter. It consists of a home page with three tabs: Chats, Status, and Calls.

The Chats tab displays a list of chats with different contacts. Each chat item is represented by a ListTile widget, showing the contact's profile picture, name, last message, and the time of the last message.

The Status tab shows a list of status updates from contacts. Each status item is represented by a ListTile widget, displaying the contact's profile picture with a green border, name, and the time of the status update.

The Calls tab displays a list of call records. Each call item is represented by a ListTile widget, showing the contact's profile picture, name, a subtitle indicating a missed call, and either a phone icon or a video call icon based on the index of the item.

I have also added an app bar with a search icon, a menu icon for additional options (New Group, New Contact, Logout), and a title with the WhatsApp logo. The app bar also features a bottom navigation bar with tabs for easy navigation between the Chats, Status, and Calls sections.
